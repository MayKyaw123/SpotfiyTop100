# This is the final report for our teamâ€™s database project. Our team chose to construct a database
# that holds information about songs in Spotify. Songs have a lot of different categories and they
# have a lot of attributes that allow us to build a database that we can then use to categorize and
# analyze information about songs.

# Our idea was to build a database that would capture this information for a wide variety of songs
# so that we could quickly learn information about songs and to run queries that let us answer
# questions about how songs are related and how certain people are involved in multiple songs.
# We chose this topic because it interested us and it allowed us to use a database to answer
# questions of interest that we had about how different songs are related
